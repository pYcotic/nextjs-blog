## The first post upload

i hope my face looks good.

So this is the first post. Everyone said to create a profile blog so here it is. I wanted to learn how to use Nextjs as my vision is to do backend dev work. I have currently got some experiance in Express and Django. Now Next, I must say the two days it took to build this was really cool and easy to understand, I don't think i fully get the staticGen functions but it will get better and that's something to look forward to. This is currently running on vercel but i should be moving to amazon soon.

My first task will be to add a comment box and find a way to store it.

### Goodbye
